Program 3 : test_stringDelete

START PROGRAM

	INCLUDE - Importing standard input/outp library #include <stdio.h>
	INCLUDE - Importing standard string library #include <string.h>
	DEFINE - Setting #define SIZE 20

	STRUCT -  Declaring the struc function Word
		  Declaring the char array c with length SIZE
		  Declaring int num
		  Declaring the char array d with length SIZE

	STATIC STRUCT - Declaring the name of my struct to use in whole program

	PROTOTYPE FUNCTIONS - declaring them before main getWordNum and stringDelete
	
	MAIN -  Declaring main int function
		Declaring int variable len
		Initializing len by calling the fucntion getWordNum
		CALL function stringDelete(len)
		RETURN
		
	FUNCTION: getWordNum() is executed
		  Declaring int variables l
		  PRINT "Type word"
		  FGETS: gets the value input and stores it in my array w.c
		  STRLEN(): using it to get the size of the word input
		  PRINT "Type position to be deleted"
		  SCANF(): stores the value input using the pointer &w.num
		  RETURN l

	FUNCTION: stringDelete() is executed
		  Declaring int variable i
		  STRCPY() :copying all char array in w,c into w.d
		  DECREASING w.num by 1 - to obtain the exactly position 
		  
		  FOR LOOP:     repeat body until statement is reached i<x

				IF: statement is TRUE (i < w.num)
					stores the value w.d[i] = w.d[i]
					END IF STATEMENT
				ELSE :
					stores the value such as w.d[i] = w.d[i+1];
					END ELSE STATEMENT

        	  END FOR LOOP
		  
		  PRINT "Original word = w.c"
		  PRINT "Modified word = w.d"  

	END FUNCTION
	
END PROGRAM
