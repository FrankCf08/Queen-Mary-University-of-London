START PROGRAM

	INCLUDE - Importing standard input/outp library #include <stdio.h>
	DEFINE - MACRO STUDENTS 3
	DEFINE - MACRO MARKS 4
			
	PROTOTYPE FUNCTIONS - declaring them before main average
	
	MAIN -  Declaring main int function
		Declaring a double arrat std_grades[STUDENTS][MARKS]
		CALL function average() and passing the arrat std_grades in its parameter
		RETURN
		
	FUNCTION: average() is executed, having as a parameter the array std_grades
		  Declaring int variables i, j
		  Declaring and initializing float variables sum =0

		  FOR LOOP: Repeat until statement is reached i<STUDENTS
			    PRINT "Grades for student + i"
			    FOR LOOP: Repeat until statement is reached j<MARKS
				      Variable sum is added with the values of the array with indexes [i][j]
				      PRINT "grade"
				      END FOR LOOP
			    PRINT  "Student average = sum/float"
			    sum is set to zero

		  END FOR LOOP

	END FUNCTION
