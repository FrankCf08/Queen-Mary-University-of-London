Program 1 : verticalBarChart

START PROGRAM

	INCLUDE - Importing standard input/outp library #include <stdio.h>
	DEFINE - Setting #define Limit 10
	DEFINE - Setting #define NUMSTD 2
	DEFINE - Setting #define MAXMARKS 3
	STRUCT -  Declaring the struc function as Students
		  Declaring the char array name with length SIZE
		  Declaring long int idnum
		  Declaring float array marks with length MAXMARKS

	STATIC STRUCT - Declaring the name of my struct to use in whole program

	PROTOTYPE FUNCTIONS - declaring them before main creatingStudent and printDetails
	
	MAIN -  Declaring main int function
		CALL function vcreatingStudent()
		CALL function printDetails()
		RETURN
		
	FUNCTION: creatingStudent() is executed
		  Declaring int variables i, j

		  FOR LOOP: repeat body until statement is reached i<NUMSTD
		  	    PRINT "Enter Student"
		  	    SCANF() stores the input value using the pointer of std.name
		  	    PRINT "Enter student id number"
		  	    SCANF() stores the input value using the pointer of std.idnum

	   		    FOR LOOP:   repeat body until statement is reached j<MAXMARKS
		  	    		PRINT "Enter mark"
		  	    		SCANF() stores the input value using the pointer of std.marks[j]
					END FOOR LOOP
		  END FOOR LOOP

	END FUNCTION

	FUNCTION: printDetails() is executed
		  Declaring int variables i,j
		  Declaring and initializing float sum =0
		  PRINT "List of stundets"
		  
		  FOR LOOP:     repeat body until statement is reached i<NUMSTD
				PRINT "std.name and std.idnum"  	
			    	
			    	FOR LOOP: repeat body until statement is reached j<MAXMARKS	
			    	      	  sum is added with std.marks[j] and stored in it again
			    		  PRINT "std.marks[j]"
			        	  END FOR LOOP
				sum is divided between 3
				PRINT "sum"
				set sum = 0
        	  END FOR LOOP

	END FUNCTION
